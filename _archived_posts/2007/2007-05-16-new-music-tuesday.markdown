<p>After work I stopped by Best Buy (sorry, I needed something else that the local record shop didn’t carry) and picked up <a href="http://wilcoworld.net/">Wilco’s</a> new album, <a href="http://wilcoworld.net/sbs/index.php">Sky Blue Sky</a>. She let me splurge and get the Special Deluxe Edition on one condition, that she didn’t have to see or hear the DVD. The previous Wilco DVDs have been great - I’ve probably watched <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Am-Trying-Break-Your-Heart/dp/B00008IAMJ/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-2778195-4221713?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dvd&amp;qid=1179286893&amp;sr=8-1">I Am Trying To Break Your Heart</a> at least ten times - and based on the first 15 minutes of this one, it’s going to be good too.</p>

<p>This record will probably be in constant rotation until Ryan Adams’ new disc comes out. I just read that the May 2007 Rolling Stone said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We Love “Easy Tiger” Ryan’s stunning new record. Nothing has rivaled his classic debut, 2000’s uniformly gorgeous Heartbreaker…until now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s a toss-up between Gold and Heartbreak, but I love the early Ryan Adams stuff. I can’t wait until June 26th!</p>
