I saw today that Wordpress 2.2 was released. I went ahead and upgraded (<a href="http://www.eightfivethree.com/2007/02/19/installing-wordpress-and-keeping-it-up-to-date/">in about 1 minute</a>) and instantly noticed some changes to my sidebar. Version 2.2 somehow enables widgets across all themes or something. Iâ€™m not sure how they did it, but it is very cool.
