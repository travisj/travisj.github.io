title: "Ad Tags Widget"
---
<p>After upgrading to Wordpress 2.2 yesterday, I decided I needed to write my first widget. Since I also needed to start monetizing this blog (I’ve been leaving big bucks on the table for years!), I created a Direct Media Exchange Ad Tags widget. It’s not the most elegant widget - at this point you have to know your DMX section id and it doesn’t even support combo tags - but it gets the job done. If you have a Direct Media Exchange account and want to try out the plugin, go ahead and download it from the link below.</p>

<p>To use the widget, you need to extract the plugin from the zip download and upload the plugin to your plugins directory. Then log in to your admin section and activate the plugin. You then need to click on Presentation and then the Widgets submenu. From there you can drag the DMX widget into Sidebar 1 or wherever else you want to put it.</p>

<p>I’ve noticed that the MyBlogLog widget and Direct Media Exchange tags do not play very nicely together. If the MyBlogLog widget is above the ad tag, then the ad doesn’t show. Just something to keep in mind.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I made this plugin as some guy that just wanted to make it easier for the world to put ads on their site, not as an employee of Right Media or a contributor to <a href="http://direct.rightmedia.com/">Direct Media Exchange</a>. Install at your own risk, I’ve only tested it about three times (anymore and our support team would probably suspect me of impression fraud).</p>
