For fun tonight I decided to create a stripped down  interface to my wordpress blog to allow for easier mobile posting. Iâ€™m using the MetaWeblog API to post and as a result can open up the interface to anyone that has a blog that supports the same API. If interested in blogging from your phone log into the simple web app at <a href="http://m.mechroboticon.com/">http://m.mechroboticon.com/</a> and enjoy.
