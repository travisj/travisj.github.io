title: "Studio version of “The Thanks I Get”"
---
<p>I got an email today from <a href="http://wilcoworld.net">Wilco</a> saying that I could download the studio version of “The Thanks I Get” by simply putting the new album, Sky Blue Sky, in my computer. I popped the disc and and sure enough I was able to download the song. So simple.</p>

<p>And on another music related note, <a href="http://offtheisland.com">Cam</a> wrote me today saying that he had found Ryan Adams’ new album online. The mp3s are on the Lost Highway website. As it turns out, it was only a few songs from Easy Tiger, but the gem below was included. I’m not exactly sure what a “halloween head” is, but Ryan makes a pretty good song out of it:</p>
