<p>A lot has happened since the last time I posted to this blog:</p>

<p>Rachel graduated last weekend and our families came to town for the event. Rachel has <a href="http://www.rljart.com/blog/?p=1084">a great recap of the weekend</a>.</p>

<p>Last Monday we went to <a href="http://ofarevolution.com">O.A.R</a> when they came to Eugene. The first time I saw them it was in Chicago at the UIC Pavilion and there was probably 5,000+ people there. This show was much different. The McDonald Theater seemed empty, which luckily didn’t seem to bother the band. They played a lot of my favorites and took requests from the audience. For their encore they played Sunday Bloody Sunday by U2. The song below is them performing the same song at a different venue.</p>

<p>Finally, I took Rachel to the airport today and watched her fly off to Italy. She’ll be there for a month. My plan is to go to work, go to the gym and then come home and watch at least one movie every single day. We’ll see how successful I am.</p>
