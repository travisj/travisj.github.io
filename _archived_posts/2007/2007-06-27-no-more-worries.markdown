title: "No more worries"

<p>I get the feeling that my family is very worried about me since Rachel is in Italy. Well family, I’m doing fine. I’m (involuntarily) taking the <a href="http://www.specialk.com/">New Special K Challenge™</a> - the one where you kick start your day with a bowl of Special K and replace another meal with a second bowl of Special K. I usually eat my second bowl at dinner because I am too lazy to cook the microwave dinners I bought for myself. To be fair though, we don’t have a microwave, so to be expected to wait 30+ minutes while my 300 calorie meal slow cooks in the oven just isn’t that appealing.</p>

<p>On a serious note though, I picked up the new Ryan Adams album tonight. And get this, in addition to only paying $10.99, I got a <strong>free</strong> Easy Tiger poster AND a <strong>free</strong> live performance DVD. I’m keeping my poster in pristine condition until I can figure out what to do with it. If I take it into the office and hang it in my corner it will probably be faded by the sun by the end of summer. If I hang it somewhere in the house, I will only be able to keep it up until Rachel gets home. Either way, I’ve only got about a month of good use out of it (and yes, that was a cheap shot at the length of Oregon summers). The album is good, I like when he plays electric, but his acoustic songs - especially if he adds a little banjo - are always my favorite. Easy Tiger leans pretty heavily towards acoustic, which I think is going to mean good things.</p>

<p>Now that I’ve worried everyone about my eating habits, I’m going to get some dessert (probably a third bowl of Special K) and try to stay up with my goal of watching a movie a night. Tonight’s “movie” will probably be 4-5 episodes of The Office Season 2. Sometime soon I’ll post the movies I am trying to watch during my month alone.</p>
