I just signed up for <a href="http://pownce.com/travisj/">my Pownce account</a> and I’ve got six invites if anyone is interested. I’m not quite sure what you do with Pownce, but it looks like a pretty sweet web app. The file sending feature looks useful, but you can only send files to friends and I don’t have any friends <img src="http://www.eightfivethree.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" /> Be my friend and I’ll hook you up with some great new tunes.
