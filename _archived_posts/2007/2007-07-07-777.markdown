<p>I realized while at work today that Saturday would by July 7th, 2007 or 07/07/07, aka 777. I figure itâ€™s going to be a lucky day.</p>

<p>The only thing I really have planned for tomorrow is to hit up the bookstore and pick out a new book. I am a few pages from finishing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Can-Keep-Jersey-Countries-Basketball/dp/034549136X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-0417443-5800154?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1183794345&amp;sr=8-1">Can I Keep My Jersey</a> and am looking for something new. Any suggestions?</p>
