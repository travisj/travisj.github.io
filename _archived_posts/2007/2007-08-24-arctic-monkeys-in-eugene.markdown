<p>I found out a couple weeks ago, but have been too forgetful to mention here that the <a href="http://www.arcticmonkeys.com/">Arctic Monkeys</a> are coming to Eugene on September 28th. Theyâ€™re playing at the <a href="http://www.mcdonaldtheatre.com/">McDonald Theatre</a> and the show is going to rock. Anyone want to come with me?</p><p>For a little preview of the Arctic Monkeys, check out their music video on my Facebook profile.</p><p>
