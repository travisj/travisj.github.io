title: "Pandora Question"
---
<p>I’ve been listening to <a href="http://www.pandora.com">Pandora</a> a lot lately and had a question about the stations I created. When I’m listening to a station, and rate it, do those rating affect the station if other people listen to it?</p><p>And this post successfully concludes what I was testing, no more junk posts for a little while <img src="http://www.eightfivethree.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" /></p><p>
