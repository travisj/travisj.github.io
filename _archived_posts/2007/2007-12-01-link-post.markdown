<p><img src="http://www.eightfivethree.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/autzen-stadium.jpg" alt="Autzen Stadium" title=""></p> <p>I got to go to the Ducks vs. Beavers Civil War game this afternoon. This was my first game at Autzen and it definitely lived up to itâ€™s reputation. The Ducks ended up losing in overtime, but the game was pretty exciting.</p>
