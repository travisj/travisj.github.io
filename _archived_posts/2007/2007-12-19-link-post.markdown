<p>Wyclef was recently on MHD with his <a href="http://music.yahoo.com/promo-31904706-222-20071204-" title="Yahoo! Music">Yahoo! Music/Live Sets performance</a> and it was a great show. I really like the format of the Live Sets, but most importantly I like the artists they bring on (except <a href="http://music.yahoo.com/promo-31904706-222-20071001-" title="Yahoo! Music">Rascal Flatts</a> - I won’t be DVR’ing that one). I feel a lot like Hansel describing his respect for Sting when I talk about Wyclef, but I do like his music and have especially been liking <em>If I Was President</em> lately.</p> <p><object width="428" height="480"><param name="movie" value="http://cosmos.bcst.yahoo.com/up/embed/embedflv/swf/fop_embed.swf?id=v51592502&amp;eID=1301797&amp;pm=0">
