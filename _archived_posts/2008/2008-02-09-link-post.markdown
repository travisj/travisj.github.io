<p>It’s been a while since I promised to post a recap of the Ryan Adams and the Cardinals show that I went to in Salem. I guess I’ve been busy, but the show was incredible. Ryan was pretty talkative and the Cardinals seemed pretty cool. I came across <a href="http://www.ryanadamsarchive.com/showthread.php?t=8349">the recorded show</a> last night and downloaded it. I’m hoping to give it a full listen today on our drive up to Portland for Rachel’s birthday. Below are a couple of my favorite tracks from the night.</p> <p><a href="http://www.eightfivethree.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/rescue_blues.mp3" title="The Rescue Blues">The Rescue Blues</a></p> <p><a href="http://www.eightfivethree.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/sweet_carolina.mp3" title="Oh My Sweet Carolina">Oh My Sweet Carolina</a></p>
