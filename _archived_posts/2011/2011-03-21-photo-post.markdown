<p>red bulls celebrating after juan agudelo puts the ball in the back of the net for the first goal of the season.Â </p>&#13;
<p>i am so excited for the season. i've got season tickets with a buddy and red bull arena is a fantastic place to watch soccer. it is going to be a good summer (especially if agudelo and henry keep scoring)!</p>
