<p>Today was our big day in Amsterdam. We slept in late and started the day off with lunch at <a href="http://www.stach-food.nl/">STACH</a>&nbsp;and then headed to <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CDcQFjAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rijksmuseum.nl%2Fen&amp;ei=IKVBU9TtCeLH7Ab_1IHgBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNEUsQdpZJGm86KP0tSOqyXIAsihgw&amp;sig2=FL1wuaey-6EJD8CS_m8AvA&amp;bvm=bv.64125504,d.ZGU">Rijkesmuseum</a>&nbsp;for a couple hours.</p>
<p>We had to stick to our schedule and get over to <a href="http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp">The Van Gogh Museum</a> by 3:00pm. On our walk between the museums we stopped for a quick snack and a few more photos.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed The Van Gogh Museum. I didn't know much about Van Gogh before this and was fascinating to see his progression as a painter in just 10 years. I liked the various self portraits they had, their sunflowers were on loan in London and my favorite of the collection was&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_of_a_Skeleton_with_Burning_Cigarette">Skull of a Skeleton with Burning Cigarette</a>.</p>
<p>After the museums we were headed out for dinner when we happened upon a stroopwafel stand. They were made to order and delicious.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Dinner was meat and potatoes for both of us. I think we ate at a pretty touristy place, but the food was great, so I have nothing to complain about.</p>
<p>After dinner we wandered around just taking in the sights.</p>

<p>Tomorrow morning we plan to visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.albertcuyp.nl/languages/english/">Albert Cuyp Markt</a>&nbsp;for some fresh herring and more stroopwafels. After, we are going to get on train and make a stop in Cologne for a couple hours then head to Bacharach for two nights.</p>
<p>I'll post more again soon, thanks for reading.</p>
