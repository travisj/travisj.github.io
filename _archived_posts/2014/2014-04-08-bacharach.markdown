<p>We spent the day exploring castles. We started off by climbing above Bacharach to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stahleck_Castle">Stahsech Castle</a>. After checking out the sights from up high, we ran down to the river and caught a cruise to St. Goar. At St. Goar we saw another castle,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheinfels_Castle">Rheinfels Castle</a>. We caught up with a guided tour, it was in German, but a docent-in-training spoke English and would give us the highlights of what was said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've got lots of photos to show off, but not enough internet to share them.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we are headed back down the Rhine river to check out another castle.</p>
<p>Finally, it exciting trip news, we decided to skip Munich, stay in Bacharch an extra day and then head to Fuessen. In Fuessen, we are going to see - you guessed it - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuschwanstein_Castle">another castle</a>!</p>
<p>I'll add photos when I can. Thanks for reading.</p>
