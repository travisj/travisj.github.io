<p><span>Today we made the trip from Bacharach to F&uuml;ssen. The trip took about six and a half hours, but went well. I spent most of the trip taking pictures of Rachel, but by the end of the trip to F&uuml;ssen, the scenery became amazing.</span></p>

<p>Yesterday, we didn't have access to the internet, so I didn't get to share any updates. We took another boat from Bacharach to Braubach. There we hiked up to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marksburg">Marksburg Castle</a>&nbsp;and took a guided, English tour. This castle was still in tact and had an interesting history beginning in the 1100's and running all the way through WWII.</p>
<p>After the castle we walked around the town until the boat was supposed to come and take us to Koblenz. The boat never came, so we took the train and found a good dinner in Koblenz. We then took the train back to Bacharach and packed for our departure from Bacharach.</p>

<p>While on the boat we made friends with a tour group from Thailand.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we are getting up early to head to the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuschwanstein_Castle">Neuschwanstein Castle</a>&nbsp;and maybe&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schloss_Hohenschwangau">Hohenschwangau Castle</a>. After that, we are hopping back on the train and heading to Vienna, Austria. This will be our third country and fourth city.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
