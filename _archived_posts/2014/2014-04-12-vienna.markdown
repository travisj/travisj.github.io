<p>We packed a lot into today - in a good way. We started out the day with a short run and ended at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naschmarkt">Naschmarkt</a>&nbsp;for a few baked goods.</p>
<p>We then headed over to the marathon expo to pick up my number. Nothing too exciting happened at the expo.</p>
<p>The expo center was right by the Prater so we, of course, headed there after. We explored the grounds a bit and then rode the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_Riesenrad">Wiener Riesenrad</a>&nbsp;<span>(</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language" title="German language">German</a><span>&nbsp;for "Viennese giant wheel"). We got some great views of the city and beyond - it was such a clear day.</span></p>

<p></p>
<p>Next we took off for&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%B6nbrunn_Palace">Sch&ouml;nbrunn Palace</a>,&nbsp;built by the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Habsburg">Habsburg</a>&nbsp;family. We went on the audio tour and saw 40 impressive rooms. It was a bit hard to keep all the different kings, queens and their children straight, but it was a good tour. The grounds were even more impressive, but we didn't walk around them too much. I am hoping to find some time before we leave to spend some more time in the gardens.</p>

<p></p>
<p>We don't have too many plans for tomorrow, other than the marathon, but I hope to see something after - even if it's just back up the street to the&nbsp;Naschmarkt for more baked goods.</p>
<p>Danke f&uuml;r das Lesen.</p>
