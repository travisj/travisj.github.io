<p>Yesterday was our last day in Vienna, and since we didn't catch our night train to Venice until 9pm, we had the whole day to cross off any remaining activities. So after a traditional Viennese breakfast with our friends, we parted ways and headed to&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Stephen's_Cathedral,_Vienna">St. Stephen's Cathedral</a>&nbsp;for a look at their treasury. They had some interesting relics and a great view of the inside of the cathedral.</p>

<p>Our next stop was the&nbsp;Capuchin Church to see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Crypt">Imperial Crypt</a> of the Habsburg family. I have become a fan of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Joseph_I_of_Austria">Franz Joseph</a>&nbsp;on this trip and was especially excited to see his tomb.</p>

<p>Finally, we headed to the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Treasury,_Vienna">Imperial Treasury</a>&nbsp;to see the Habsburg's collection of family treasures and religious relics. My favorite item in the collection was the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Crown_of_the_Holy_Roman_Empire">Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire</a>.</p>
<p>We also found time to sneak in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachertorte">Sachertorte</a>&nbsp;and apple strudel. So delicious!</p>

<p></p>
<p>With a fun day in the books, we headed for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien_Westbahnhof_railway_station">Wien Westbahnhof</a>&nbsp;and boarded the overnight train to Venice. More on that to come.</p>
