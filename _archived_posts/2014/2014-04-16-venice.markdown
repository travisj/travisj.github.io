<p>We arrived to a sunny Venice at about 8:30am. The overnight train was pretty good. We had a small room to ourselves and were both able to sleep pretty well through the train ride.</p>
<p>We exited the train station and were immediately in Venice - the Grand Canal was right in front of us with boats moving in every direction. We caught the next&nbsp;Vaporetto toward our hotel.</p>
<p>Venice has lots of little streets everywhere and only certain ones have bridges, so I was quite proud of myself for unlocking my phone before leaving for the trip and picking up an Italian SIM card at the train station which gave us plenty of data for loading maps (or in Rachel's case, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook).</p>
<p>It was too early to check into our room, so we dropped our bags off and wandered around Venice for a couple hours. It was a beautiful day and nearly impossible to pass a canal without taking a picture.</p>

<p>Today we are headed for Murano, Burano and Torcello, which definitely means more pictures!</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed this recap, it was a great first day in Venice for us.</p>
