<p>We decided to check out Burano and Murano for our second day in Venice. I loved Burano. When we got off the bus, we had a fried fish lunch right by the water and then explored the area for a couple hours.</p>

<p>We wanted to try and fit in Torcello, too, but were running short on time, so we took the bus back to Murano. On Murano, we wandered through the streets and into the many glass shops, Rachel found a glass ring and we got a couple snacks before catching the bus back to Venice.</p>

<p>On Thursday we plan to go to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.guggenheim-venice.it/inglese/default.html">Peggy Guggenheim Collection</a>&nbsp;and walk around more of Venice. We're going to try and make it to&nbsp;Campo Santa Margherita on the recommendation of a friend for some gelato, but we mostly want to take it easy before our upcoming busy weekend in Rome.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
