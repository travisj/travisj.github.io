<p>Today we took it easy. We left the hotel late and walked toward&nbsp;Campo Santa Margherita to find some lunch and gelato. We found both and they were delicious - especially the gelato (<a href="https://twitter.com/shaneadams/status/456039525207126017">thanks Shane</a>!).</p>

<p></p>
<p>We then walked over to the <a href="http://www.guggenheim-venice.it/inglese/default.html">Peggy Guggenheim Collection</a>&nbsp;and had a nice afternoon looking at art. The permanent collection is comprised of works from Peggy Guggenheim's personal collection and was nice, but I greatly preferred the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.guggenheim-venice.it/inglese/collections/collection2.php?id_cat=18">Hannelore B. and Rudolph B. Schulhof Collection</a>. My favorite from the Schulhof collection were the Ellsworth Kelly paintings and would have liked to have seen the de Kooning and Rothko in the collection, but they were not up. From the permanent collection, my favorite was from an artist I had never heard of before. named Ren&eacute; Margritte, titled <a href="http://www.guggenheim-venice.it/inglese/collections/artisti/dettagli/opere_dett.php?id_art=103&amp;id_opera=206&amp;page=">Empire of Light</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the Guggenheim, we walked around a bit and found our way to&nbsp;Piazza San Marco to sit and watch all the activity as the sun went down.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is our last day in Venice. We are going on a guided tour of&nbsp;St Mark's Basilica in the morning and then taking the train to Rome.</p>
<p>If you have any suggestions of things to see or places to eat in Rome, please let us know in the comments. Thanks!</p>
