<p>This morning Rachel and I took a walking tour of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mark%27s_Basilica">St Mark's Basilica</a>. Before entering the church, we had about an hour walk around the area with the tour guide pointing out other sights - like the Rialto Bridge and Marco Polo's house.&nbsp;St Mark's Basilica was the highlight, of course. The inside was massive and the mosaic work was amazing. We also got to go upstairs to the museum to see the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horses_of_Saint_Mark">horses</a>&nbsp;and look out over the plaza.</p>

<p>After the tour, we caught the water bus back to the train station and boarded the train for Rome. This was the first truly high-speed train we have ridden on this trip, reaching a maximum speed of about 250 km/h. At top speed it was a challenge to walk around the car.</p>
<p>Once in Rome, we checked into the hotel, ate some pizza and now are resting before our big day tomorrow.&nbsp;We are going on a tour of the Vatican tomorrow and I am pretty excited to see it all.</p>
<p>Have you ever been to Rome? We are here until Tuesday, what should we do? Thanks for sharing.</p>
