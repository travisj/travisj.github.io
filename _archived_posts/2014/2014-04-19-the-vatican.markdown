<p>Today we went on a three and a half hour guided tour of the Vatican and it was both impressive and exhausting. There is so much to see in the Vatican Museum, but after a while it all starts looking the same and you lose track the the different 266 popes. We did get to see a lot on the tour - a couple gardens, various walkways between the residences filled with statues and painted ceilings, the Sistine Chapel and St. Peter's Basilica.</p>
<p>I enjoyed St. Peter's Basilica the most because of just how massive and ornate the building is.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After dinner we walked around a bit and found our way to Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our tour of the catacombs for tomorrow was cancelled because a few of the sights are closed due to Easter so we are figuring out our plans now. Suggestions are welcome. Thanks.</p>
