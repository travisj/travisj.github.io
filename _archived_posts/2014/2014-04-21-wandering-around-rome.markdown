<p>Yesterday we spent the day seeing the ancient sites in Rome. We started out at the Pantheon and had bright sunlight beaming through the dome’s opening.</p>

<p>After some wandering and lunch, we headed for the Coliseum. I’ve seen the arena many times in pictures and on TV, but still found it massive and impressive.</p>

<p>We are now on the train and headed for Naples. We plan to see the national archeological museum and eat pizza.</p>
