<p>We took a day trip to Naples before leaving Rome. It was only about an hour train ride on the high speed train. I wasn't sure what to expect, but did know to expect it to be a bit more intense than Rome. And it definitely was. We got off the train and went straight for pizza at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.damichele.net/">L' Antica Pizzeria da Michele</a>. The pizza was some of the best I've ever had. It was just a margherita, but the sauce, cheese and crust were all perfect. We were seated with a couple of locals that sort of spoke English (much better than our Italian) and had a good time chatting with them about Naples.</p>
<p>We then went to the National Archeological Museum and roamed the halls for a couple hours. They have a bunch of stuff from Pompeii and it is really interesting to see their art and everyday tools, but since they have so much it all starts to look the same after a while. I was most impressed with their baking ware and dishes. They looked much more advanced than I would have expected for nearly 2,000 years ago.</p>
<p>We then decided to try and find a beach or at least see the water, so we wandered in that general direction for a bit. Along the way we walked through the&nbsp;Umberto the Ist Gallery. It seems like at one time the gallery was an impressive shopping center, but today it just feels like a massive, abandoned structure with people selling fake handbags and scarves in the middle. We tried a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sfogliatelle">sfogliatelle</a> and I found it to be about as good as I thought&nbsp;<span>sweetened ricotta&nbsp;</span><span>cheese in a pastry would taste.</span></p>
<p><span>Once we finally made it to the water, we took in a clear view of&nbsp;Mount Vesuvius, snapped a few pictures and headed back to the train station. I was ready to leave Naples. The food was great, but the city was more intense and busy that I liked.</span></p>

<p>We got back to Rome and got ready for our trip to Florence. More on that soon.</p>
<p>We originally planned to go to Lauterbrunnen, Switzerland at the end of this week, but started looking at the weather recently and saw that it was going to be in the teens and 100% chance of snow. We packed as light as we could for this trip, which meant my snow coat didn't make the cut. As a result, we cancelled our hotel in Lauterbrunnen and are looking for an alternative. We are thinking about heading toward Lake Geneva in Switzerland, maybe staying in Lausanne, but are open to recommendations. We really want to stay in Switzerland and be as close to the Alps as possible, but still be warm enough to go out and hike. If you have any suggestions, please let us know. Thanks.</p>
