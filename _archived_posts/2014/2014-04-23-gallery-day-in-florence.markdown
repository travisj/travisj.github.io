category: fourweeks

<p>Today we took full advantage of our Firenze Card and started the day off with a trip to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uffizi">Uffizi Gallery</a>. The Uffizi is said to have the greatest collection of Italian painters anywhere. The highlight for me was the room full of Botticelli paintings. Other than that, I didn't really enjoy it. Many works were hard to see because of the odd viewing areas through the transoms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After lunch we did some much-needed laundry and set out for T<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galleria_dell%27Accademia">he Accademia</a>. I didn't know anything about this museum except that Michelangelo's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_(Michelangelo)">David</a> was here. <a href="http://instagram.com/p/nIxqJCi0Az/">David</a> was more impressive than I expected. We've seen a lot of sculpture over the last few weeks, but David was, better than anything else we've seen. It was the combination of size (we overheard an amateur tour guide claim he was 17' 1") and clean finish that impressed me the most. Other than David, the gallery didn't have much that captured my interest.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we head to Varenna on Lake Como for a couple days of relaxation and hiking. Before we leave Florence, we are going to get a little more use out of our cards and climb to the top of the bell tower and visit the Duomo Museum.</p>
<p>I didn't take as many pictures today, but really like this one of Rachel from the roof garden at the Uffizi with the Duomo in the background.</p>
