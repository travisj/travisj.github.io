<p>The next stop on our trip was Varenna, a small town in northern Italy on Lake Como. After a few weeks of busy cities and lots of museums we decided we needed a change of pace. Varenna was a perfect spot to recharge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After taking the train to Varenna, we had about a mile hike with our bags uphill to our hotel. It was hot, but when we made it to our room and walked out onto our balcony the view made it all worth it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Friday we went for a hike and found another castle and a waterfall. This castle was cool because they had a small falconry and brought the birds out for us to see. The waterfall was cool because it was runoff from the snowy Italian Alps.</p>

<p>For our last full day on Lake Como we decided to take the boat over to Bellagio. Bellagio was nice, with more shopping and more people than Varenna, but not much else. We explored a bit and got some gelatto, then we caught the boat back to Varenna.</p>

<p>And with that, we are on the train to Switzerland. We are heading to Lausanne today and going to spend two nights eating fondue and checking out the Alps.</p>
