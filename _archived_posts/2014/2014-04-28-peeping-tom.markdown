<p>In my post about Varenna I accidentally left out one event that both horrified me and still has us laughing when we think about it.</p>
<p>One thing that is different with the hotels we have stayed at than ones I have stayed at before is that the hotel usually put the key on a big, heavy key ring and asks that leave the key at the front desk when you go out. The one difference with our hotel in Varenna was that the front desk closed at midnight, so if you wanted to stay out later, you had to take a bunch of different keys with you to get into the hotel and then into your room.</p>
<p>Also, it was warmer than usual in Varenna and the hotel had not yet turned on the air conditioning. It mostly got hot in the afternoon as the sun shone into our room, but we could open the doors to the balcony after the sun went down and got a nice, cooling breeze.</p>
<p>On our second night, we decided to sleep with the door open since it was still pretty warm in our room. At around 1:00 am, we woke up with someone trying to get into our room. I woke up before they got in, as they were starting to peak their head around the curtains blocking the open doorway, and yelled at them to get out of the room and go away.</p>
<p>It turns out that the other family staying at the hotel did not bring their keys with them and stayed out later than they were expecting. They got locked out, saw our open door and did not know it was a room so they tried to enter the hotel through our doorway.</p>
<p>Needless to say. we kept our doors shut the rest of the time we slept in Varenna.</p>
