<p>We've made it to our final destination, Paris. I have been looking forward to this stop the entire time and our first day out did not disappoint at all.</p>
<p>We have three full days here, so on the first day we decided to go the the Louvre and the Arc de Triomphe.</p>
<p>We got an early start after breakfast at the hotel and took the metro to the Louvre. We first headed to the Italian painters section (since we didn't get enough of them in Italy) to fight the crowds and see Mona Lisa. Next, we headed to the French painters section. My favorite from this section was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Coronation_of_Napoleon">The Coronation of Napolean</a>, though I was certain I'd already seen this same one somewhere else on our trip.</p>
<p>Our next destination was the Arc de Triomphe with a few stops along the way. We first headed to <a href="http://www.angelina-paris.fr/">Angelina</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;for hot chocolate and then walked down&nbsp;<span>The Avenue des&nbsp;</span><span>Champs</span><span>-</span><span>&Eacute;lys&eacute;es for some window shopping.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We finally made it to the Arc de Triomphe and climbed to the top some impressive views of the area.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, we headed back to the hotel, found a great place to eat then called it a day.</span></p>

<p><span>Today we are going to walk around the&nbsp;Palace of Versailles. Today is May Day, which means many museums are closed, and the Palace is actually closed too, but we are going to walk around the garden and see the grounds.</span></p>
