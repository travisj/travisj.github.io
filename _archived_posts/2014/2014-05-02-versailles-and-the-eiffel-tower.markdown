<p>Today was a bit rainy and almost everything was closed due to May Day, but still had a great day. In the morning we headed out to Versailles to walk the grounds. We couldn't go in anything, but we could walk all over the gardens, so we covered as much ground as we could. I didn't mind not getting into the palace since we've seen quite a few this trip and didn't get to walk around in the impressive&nbsp;Sch&ouml;nbrunn Palace gardens.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the evening we headed over to the Eiffel Tower and made a stop at each level - including a stop on the first level for dinner. Dinner was even more fun than I expected and running around the tower in the rain with Rachel was a blast.</p>

<p>Today's our last full day of the trip. We're going to the <a href="http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/home.html">Orsay Museum</a>&nbsp;and then to Notre Dame. We also plan to find and eat as many treats as possible.</p>
