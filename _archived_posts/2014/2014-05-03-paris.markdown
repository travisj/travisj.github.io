<p>For our last full day in Paris we decided to go to the Orsay Museum and then to Notre Dame Cathedral. We got a late start and when we got to the Orsay, the line was way too long. We had the Paris Museum Pass and had priority access, but even with that, the line snaked all over the place. We decided to cut our losses and just walk around, get lunch and eventually head over to Notre Dame.</p>
<p>Lunch was fun and we checked a few shopping items off Rachel's list, but when we got over to Notre Dame the line was also longer than we wanted to wait in. We've been in a lot of cathedrals over the last four weeks and spending hours in a line to see another was not how we wanted to spend our last day. Instead, we got ice cream and then headed back over to the Orsay.</p>
<p>The Orsay had a much shorter line than earlier in the day and we got in after about twenty minutes. The museum is known for their impressionist and post-impressionist collections. There were plenty of great paintings to see, but I loved the building - an old train station - the most. It was a great setting for a museum.</p>

<p>And that's it. We've made it to Day 29 of our trip. We head to the airport in about an hour and start our trek home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>See you soon.</p>
