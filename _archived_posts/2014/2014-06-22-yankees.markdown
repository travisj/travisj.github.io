<p>I was fortunate to attend a friend's bachelor party at Yankee Stadium and even though the Yankees lost, it was still a fun way to send Matt off. For the game we had a suite on the first base with more than enough room and food for us.</p>
<p>We got the stadium around noon and settled in.</p>

<p>Around the start of the game, a couple of Yankees historians game by to show and let us hold a few historical objects. We got to see a game-worn jersey from Jeter's 3,000th hit game (apparently he quite a few that day), home plate from the last game at the old stadium and first at the new one, a bat signed and used by Mickey Mantle in the 1958 World Series, and a couple recent World Series rings.</p>

<p>The game, itself, didn't go to well for the Yankees, but I still had a great time.</p>
