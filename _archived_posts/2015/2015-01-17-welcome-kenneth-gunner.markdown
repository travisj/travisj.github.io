<p><span>Kenneth rushed into our lives on January 8th. Rachel woke up early with contractions, but by the time I needed to get ready for work, she didn't expect the baby to come any time that day so I went on my way. By two in the afternoon her contractions were coming every couple minutes and she told me to come home, she thought the baby was probably on his way.</span></p>
<p>We left for the hospital by three and made it by four. By 4:25 Rachel was in a delivery room with doctors telling her to push. All those breathing exercises and early laboring techniques we learned in our classes were thrown out the window, we got to the hospital just in time for her to push the baby out. I was quite nervous because she was in so much pain, but the doctors were beyond impressed with her because she was so strong &nbsp;in making it to this point on her own. I was and still am so proud of her.</p>
<p>After some intense pushing on Rachel's part, we got to meet Kenneth. He was born at 6:41 pm and was so unbelievably cute. He was so happy to be hugging Rachel and she was just as happy to be hugging him right back.</p>
<p>Rachel and Kenneth stayed at the hospital for a couple days and then on Saturday I got to drive them home.</p>

<p><span>Kenneth has been home with us for one week and is the perfect baby already. I love holding him, watching him make funny faces and listen to his adorable sounds. All he really does at this point is eat and sleep, but it is still so great to be with him.</span></p>
<p><span>This is no surprise to me, but Rachel is an amazing mom to Ken. Leading up to his birth, she prepared in every way possible for Ken. She is so loving toward him and he is such a happy baby in her arms.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>It's taken Rachel and me a long time to get to this point in our lives, but I am very excited for everything that lies ahead.</span></p>
