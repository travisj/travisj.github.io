<p>Kenneth got to talk to his grandparents tonight on FaceTime. He showed off his ability to sit all on his own and a few other tricks. When they make big movements, he’s able to see them and pays attention for a few seconds. It’s great having technology that keeps us connected even when we are thousands of miles apart.</p>
