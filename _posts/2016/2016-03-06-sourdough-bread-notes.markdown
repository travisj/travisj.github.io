I mentioned in [my last post](/2016/02/28/weekend-update) that I started baking my own sourdough bread from my own starter. I've now been at it for two weeks and think the bread is really starting to come along. 

Last night I prepared the dough for a basic sourdough bread, based on [this recipe](http://www.theclevercarrot.com/2014/01/sourdough-bread-a-beginners-guide/). I put in a bit more flour than the recipe called for because of a previous trial with the recipe and think it was about right, but will maybe do a bit less next time. Given that it's winter and a bit colder, I let bulk fermentation go for about 14 hours. I then split the dough in half and baked the first loaf.

The first loaf baked in the dutch oven with the lid on for 60 minutes. Since our oven has been burning the bread, I set the oven to about 410&deg;F and the temperature seemed about right this time. It still came out a bit overdone on the outside and maybe a touch underdone inside. The sourdough flavor is starting to show in these latest loaves.

The second loaf got an extra hour for the second rise and I baked it for only 50 minutes and came out looking perfect.
