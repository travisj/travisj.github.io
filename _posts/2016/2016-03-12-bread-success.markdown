I don't plan to post everytime I bake bread, but Rachel and I have further refined our recipe and had a near-perfect raisin walnut sourdough bread this morning.

I added an extra 75 grams of flour, 575g total, and cooked the bread for an hour at 450 degrees. The key we found with our oven is to put a baking sheet under the dutch oven to prevent the bottom of the bread from burning.

Bread fresh out of the oven makes for a pretty awesome breakfast.
