Rachel, Kenneth and I leave for Paris in a couple hours. We're packed and all our plans are in order. Nothing left to do except get excited.

We are taking the overnight flight to Paris and spending the rest of the day wandering around. We plan on visting the [Centre Pompidou](https://www.centrepompidou.fr/en) and a playground or two for Kenneth.

In addition to Paris, we are going to spend some time in Western France, Vienna, Prague and Amesterdam. Be on the lookup for more updates here and lots of pictures from [Rachel](https://www.instagram.com/rljart/) and [me](https://www.instagram.com/travisj).
