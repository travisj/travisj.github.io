Today we took the ferry over Dockyard to check out the [National Museum of Bermuda](http://nmb.bm/) and the rest of the area. This was our first time to this part of the island and we had a great morning. On our way over on the ferry, one of the crew told us about a playground near the museum, so we made that our first stop.

I did a some research beforehand and wanted to check out the special exhibit on the US Navy's capture of the U-505 during WWII. My grandfather served in the Navy and was is Bermuda when they captured the German submarine.

The U-505 exhibit was a bit smaller than I was expecting, but they dedicated the rest of the room to the US Navy's history on the island and was interesting.

The museum was small, but it also had a dolphin center with dolphins playing in the water, another small playground for Ken and incredible views of the water.

We returned to the ferry for the 25-minute ride back to Hamilton and all settled into the hotel for an afternoon nap.

After a little down time at the hotel, it was time for today's main event - The KPMG Front Street Mile. I stopped by expo to pick up our race numbers and headed out to Front Street to wait for the race to start.

The race went well, I finished in 6:33, which was good enough for my fastest Front Steet Mile yet. Due to injury, I haven't been running too much over the last six weeks, so I plan to take it easy tomorrow and hope to run the marathon on Sunday.

I'll keep you posted.
