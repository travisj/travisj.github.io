This trip is going fast. It's already the night before the marathon.

Today Rachel, Kenneth and I ran the Bermuda 10k together. The 10k is a preview for what's to come in the marathon - heat and hills. We had a fun time and enjoyed all the spectators that came out to cheer on the runners.

After the run, we made our way back to my favorite restaurant on the island, [BouchÃªe](http://www.bouchee.bm/). Breakfast here after the 10k has become a tradition that I was ready to repeat this year. Ken and I shared a pancake meal and a traditional English breakfast - Ken took care of our bacon and I took care of the rest.

In preparation for the race tomorrow, we came back to the hotel for some rest. Ken decided he didn't want to nap, so we went to the pool and swam for an hour. I picked up dinner from the market and we ate it on the balcony while Ken played with his knives and bread.

I took a time-lapse video with my Garmin Virb during the race today that turned out well. Ken kicked it a few times and it mysteriously turned off midway through the run and took a few minutes before I noticed. Enjoy.
